# MySQL-Workbench-Project
Based on this project, I created the database of a company, I created the tables used within the company, I populated the tables with a set of random data, and finally I displayed the contents of the tables.

Learning from this project, I went through the following steps:

I successfully managed to use basic functions and also understand the differences between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

- Learn what tables are and write basic SELECT statements
- Use wildcard characters for pattern matching and sort query results
- Add data to a database with INSERT statements
- Delete table from a database with DROP TABLE statements
- Join tables together to produce meaningful reports
